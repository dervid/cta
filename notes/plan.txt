preliminary notes

so these are the steps as I imagine them now:

	1. design preliminary flowchart or diagram showing how software will work; build out as much as possible but consider this a draft

	2. set up git repository

	3. set up virtualenv with requirements.txt file and set up project locally

	4. design data tables with column names, types and sizes - create with notes, not SQL - this is presumably handled by SQLAlchemy

	5. design data objects and OOP inheritance design; consider how the objects will map to tables

	6. ask AI to generate sqlalchemy to map data objects to tables (object-relational mapping)

	7. add setter, getter and other methods to each object to support intended functionality

	8. ask AI to write test scripts that thoroughly test objects against SQL tables

	9. add docstrings to all objects and methods, set up Sphynx documentation

	10. begin to write procedural scripts to fulfill flowchart plan
